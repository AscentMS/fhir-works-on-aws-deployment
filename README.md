# FHIR Works on AWS Solution

 FHIR Works on AWS is an open source software toolkit that can be used to add capabilities of a FHIR interface to existing healthcare software. It implements a serverless FHIR API that supports the majority of FHIR resource types and the most important operations. It also provides a set of architecture patterns to guide customers and partners through the process of designing and building integrations to their existing systems.

FHIR Works on AWS aims to help software engineers at independent software vendors, system integrators or healthcare customers to enhance their own products to provide access to data in those systems to mobile devices and web portals through integrating the FHIR standard APIs. It also allows these customers and partners to build connectors between their legacy and proprietary interfaces to the current FHIR standard. Finally, it includes guidance on how to customize the default FHIR Works on AWS API to their individual needs with specific FHIR Implementation Guides.

Many integration use cases require the ability to connect to a FHIR interface on one side and to legacy environments on the other. To help customers and partners achieve external legacy connectivity, FHIR Works on AWS includes an Integration Framework. This enables users to create their own Transforms that connect FHIR Works on AWS to any external interface, or to consume others published as open source or to the AWS Marketplace, opening up additional revenue opportunities for the partners creating them.
